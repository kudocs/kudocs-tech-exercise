# Kudocs Tech Exercise

## Exercise Intro

In this exercise, you'll see that there's a method in the `PhonePlan` class that calculates the cost of a plan differently depending on its type. However, the class should only know how to retrieve the cost, not the details of how to calculate it.  Can you refactor `PhonePlan` into a more Object Oriented solution with specs.

## Instructions

Run the setup script by doing the following:

    bin/setup

Open up `lib/phone_plan.rb`. There you will see a single method named `cost`. Its corresponding tests are in `spec/lib/phone_plan_spec.rb`.

Make sure all the tests are passing by running:

    bundle exec rspec

Make the relevant changes, zip up your project and email back to Kudocs.  Please supply any relevant supporting documentation if you feel neccessary, may cover any of the following below:
 
 * Any assumptions you made.
 * What potential problems can you identify with the existing code?
 * What approaches did you consider?
 * How does your changes improve this code?
 * Anything else you feel relevant?

The above will form the basis of a more technical discussion for your interview.
